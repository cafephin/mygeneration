!MyGenXsd3b providerplugin for MyGeneration

MyGenXsd3b ("MyMeta.Plugins.Xsd3b.dll") is a provider plugin for MyGeneration that allows to use XSDFile s (*.xsd, *.xsd3b) as datasource instead of an online sqldatabase.

MyGeneration from http://www.mygenerationsoftware.com is a template driven sourcecodegenerator that you can use free of charge.
It uses the RelationalDatastructure of a sql database (ie Microsoft SQL, Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, FireBird, Interbase, SQLite, ...) and produces sourcecode (ie C#, VB.NET code,SQL Stored Procedures, PHP, HTML, ...)
There is an online repository with lots of templates available.

Note:
in XSDFile the the interfaces of "database views" and "stored procedures" are mapped to TableDefinition and FieldDefinition.
The following fields are used to define the mapping 
	* TableDefinition DBTableType
		* TABLE this is a Database Table
		* VIEW this is the interface to a Database View
		* PROCEDURE this is the interface to a Stored Procedure
		* SYSTEM TABLE this is an Internal Database Table
	* FieldDefinition DBFieldType
		* TAB_FIELD this is a Database Field
		* PROC_INPUT this an inputparameter for a stored procedure
		* PROC_OUTPUT this an outputparameter for a stored procedure
		* PROC_IN_OUT this an input and outputparameter for a stored procedure
		* PROC_RETURN this the returnvalue of a stored procedure

!!Installation
Copy these files into the MyGeneration bin folder
	* MyMeta.Plugins.Xsd3b.dll
	* Dl3bak.Xsd3b.dll
	* Dl3bak.Xsd3b.Xsd.dll

!!Usage
	* start MyGeneration.exe
	* open the "Default Settings" dialog by selecting the menuitem "Edit/Default Settings ..."
	* make shure that the "Connection" tab is selected
	* from the combobox "Driver:" select "Xsd3b"
	* instead of a connectionstring enter the filename of a *.xsd or *.xsd3b file.
	* press ok to accept the changes
	* In the "MyMeta Browser" you can see the tables and fields of the *.xsd or *.xsd3b file.

History of MyGenXsd3b

	* Release 0.2 linked against MyMeta.dll-1.2.0.0 from MyGeneration.exe-1.2.0.7
	* 20070627 Fix: Added dummy implementatin for IMyMetaPlugin.GetDatabaseSpecificMetaData that was new to MyMeta.dll-1.2.0.0 that ships with MyGeneration.exe-1.2.0.7	
	* 20070415 Release 0.1 linked against MyMeta.dll-1.2.0.0 from MyGeneration.exe-1.2.0.2
	* 20070412 Created Templates for MyGeneration
		* ToXsd3b.csgen	(create *.xsd3b) ToXsd.csgen (create *.xsd)
		* obeys selected Tab/View/Proc
		* Import View from MyGen.MDB is very slow: Add Busy/Progressindicator

	* 20070412 MyGen2Xsd3b implemented export to xsd3b
		* Relations
		* Views/Fields
		* Procedure[DBTableType='PROCEDURE']/Parameters[DBFieldType='PROC_INPUT']/ResultColumn[DBFieldType='PROC_RETURN']
	* 20070412 Xsd3bProvider implemented mygen-provider-support for 
		* Procedure[DBTableType='*PROC*']	for PROCEDURE, SYSTEM PROCEDURE
		* Parameters[DBFieldType='*_IN*']	for PROC_INPUT or PROC_IN_OUT
		* ResultColumn[DBFieldType='*_RET*' || DBFieldType='*_OUT*'] for PROC_RETURN, PROC_OUTPUT, PROC_IN_OUT
			* ResultColumn does not work with MyMeta 1.2.0.0 : No ResultColumn-Name is displayed in Browser

	* 070409 MyGen2Xsd3b implemented export to xsd3b
		* Tables/Fields/PKs 
	* 070407 Xsd3bProvider implemented mygen-provider-support 
		* for Pk-Indexes, FK-Indexes and Views[DBTableType='*VIEW*']
	* 070401 Created Xsd3bProvider. mygen-provider-Support for Tables with Colums PKs, FKs
----
ToDo
	* MyGen2Xsd3b export sourcecode to xsd3b Element
		* IProcedure.ProcedureText and IView.ViewText
	* xsd3b <=> properties
	* test with non mdb-Datasources
